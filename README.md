# Wallet Schema Modeling

Two relational models of a multi-currency wallet balance on PostgreSQL 18,
behind one Go interface, so they can be compared side by side:

- **A. account model, currency as row** (`account*`): one mutable account row
  per (wallet, currency)
- **B. UTXO based** (`utxo*`): the balance is the sum of immutable unspent outputs

Every currency balance has an **available** (spendable) and a **held** (locked)
amount. Seeded currencies: `USD`, `USDT`, `BTC`, `ETH`.

## Layout

```
schema/schema.sql   desired schema (declarative, source of truth)
migration/          versioned migrations generated from it, plus currency seed
query/              sqlc queries: currency.sql, account.sql, utxo.sql
repo/db/            sqlc generated code (do not edit)
model/              Balance, Hold, Currency
repo/               WalletRepo interface, AccountWalletRepo, UTXOWalletRepo
```

## Quick start

Requires Docker (or Podman), [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io) and Go. sqlc runs in
Docker.

```bash
make db.init     # infra.up + migrate.apply
make             # list every target
```

Schema workflow follows [atlas-lab](https://github.com/Jyny/atlas-lab) 0.4.0
(postgres only): edit `schema/schema.sql`, then

```bash
make migrate.diff <name>   # generate a migration
make migrate.lint          # lint it
make sqlc.generate         # regenerate repo/db after query or schema changes
```

## Interface

```go
type WalletRepo interface {
	GetBalance(ctx, walletID, cur) (model.Balance, error)
	ListBalances(ctx, walletID) ([]model.Balance, error)     // every currency
	Credit(ctx, walletID, cur, amount) (model.Balance, error) // available +
	Debit(ctx, walletID, cur, amount) (model.Balance, error)  // available -
	Hold(ctx, walletID, cur, amount) (model.Hold, error)      // available -> held
	ReleaseHold(ctx, holdID) (model.Balance, error)           // held -> available
	SettleHold(ctx, holdID) (model.Balance, error)            // held -> out
}
```

Errors: `ErrInsufficientFunds`, `ErrUnknownCurrency`, `ErrInvalidAmount`
(non-positive, more fractional digits than `currency.scale`, or an amount or
resulting balance of 1e20 or more),
`ErrHoldNotFound` (unknown or already closed), `ErrContended` (UTXO model only:
the funds exist but other transactions keep them locked past the retry budget;
retry later).

## Schema

Shared: `currency(code, scale)`. Amounts are `numeric(38,18)`, enough for wei.

### A. Account model (currency as row)

The counterpart of the UTXO model, as in Ethereum's account model vs Bitcoin's
UTXO model: each (wallet, currency) is an account holding its balance.

| table           | role                                                                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `account`       | PK (wallet_id, currency); `available`, `held`, both `CHECK >= 0`     |
| `account_hold`  | one row per hold, `status` active / released / settled              |
| `account_entry` | append-only ledger entries (`available_delta`, `held_delta`) per operation |

Each operation is one guarded `UPDATE` on the account row, e.g. debit is
`SET available = available - $amt WHERE ... AND available >= $amt`, plus a hold
and an entry row in the same transaction.

### B. UTXO based

| table     | role                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `utxo_tx` | one row per operation (kind, amount, hold_id)                            |
| `utxo`    | outputs; `created_tx` / `spent_tx`, `hold_id` set = held, null = available |

Outputs are never modified except to mark them spent, once.

- credit: create one output
- debit: select available outputs oldest first until they cover the amount
  (recursive CTE, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), spend them, create a change output.
  If the selection falls short while the funds exist (outputs locked by
  concurrent operations, their change not yet visible), back off with jitter
  and retry in a fresh transaction, still skipping locks. It never waits on a
  lock, so one output held by a long transaction cannot stall spends the
  other outputs can serve. After ~1s of retries it returns `ErrContended`
- hold: same selection, then create one output of exactly the amount carrying
  `hold_id`, plus change. `UNIQUE(hold_id)`: a hold is one output
- release: spend the held output, recreate it as available
- settle: spend the held output, create nothing

Balance is `SUM(amount) FILTER (WHERE hold_id IS NULL / IS NOT NULL)` over
unspent outputs, served index-only by
`utxo_unspent_idx (wallet_id, currency) INCLUDE (amount, hold_id) WHERE spent_at IS NULL`.

History, the outputs a tx created and spent, is served by `utxo_created_tx_idx
(created_tx)` and `utxo_spent_tx_idx (spent_tx) WHERE spent_tx IS NOT NULL`.
No repo operation reads by these columns, so they only cost writes; they serve
audits, such as checking that each tx conserves value, which without them
scans the whole table per tx.

## Comparison

|                         | A. account (currency as row)                          | B. UTXO                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| read balance            | single PK lookup                                      | aggregate over unspent outputs (grows with fragmentation)       |
| write                   | 1 UPDATE (+ hold / entry insert)                      | select inputs, spend N, insert 1-2 outputs                      |
| non-negative guarantee  | `CHECK (available >= 0)` + guarded UPDATE             | outputs are positive; spends only what was selected and locked  |
| concurrency, same wallet+currency | serialized on one row lock (hot row), held ~3 round trips per write | parallel on disjoint outputs via `SKIP LOCKED`                  |
| contention failure mode | waits on the row lock                                 | skips locked outputs; when that leaves it short, backs off and retries |
| a long tx holding a lock | blocks every write of that account until it ends    | spends around the locked output; `ErrContended` only if it is needed |
| history / audit         | needs separate entries, kept in sync by the app       | intrinsic: every output records the tx that created and spent it |
| holds                   | `held` column + `account_hold` rows to keep consistent    | a hold *is* an output; no aggregate to keep in sync             |
| row growth              | 1 row per (wallet, currency); entries grow            | outputs grow per operation; needs consolidation / archiving     |
| precision               | identical, `numeric(38,18)` + per-currency `scale`    | identical                                                       |
| balance bound (< 1e20)  | exact, enforced by the column type under the row lock | per transaction: concurrent credits can exceed it (reads stay correct) |

Rule of thumb: A is simpler and reads are O(1); pick it unless a single
wallet's balance is a write hotspot, the more so when the database is a
network hop away. B trades read cost and storage for lock-free parallel spends
and a self-auditing history.

Not modeled: consolidating small outputs (B), partial settle, transfers
between wallets, a `wallet` table (wallet ids are external references).
